As a member of the Sprinklr's product design team, I helped shape the user experience for the WHO's covid tracking Dashboard. It includes a responsive global map, trends by region and country, and an interactive chart allowing users to build their own data visualization.

I was responsible for implementing designs in our custom React application using modern CSS-in-JS patterns while keeping everything organized and configurable.
