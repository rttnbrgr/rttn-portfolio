I helped rebuild the entire Sprinklr Display platform from the ground up. The platform is used for both command centers (internal facing) and social displays (think IG posts on the jumbotron at your favorite sporting event).

I helped architect the entire frontend in modern React, Typescript, and Mobx. I also built a number of our data visualization modules which were powered by D3.

I design and implemented a variety of visualizations based around social post data. Our visualizations helped showcase the content and surface insightful engagement metrics and trends.
