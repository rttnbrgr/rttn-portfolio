My primary work as the design systems engineer was to help our team work more efficiently, remove friction, and communicate more effectively with other stakeholders.

I organized and documented existing styles, components, and patterns. The effort provided clarity on exact specification (color, size, state, etc) and guidance on when it was appropriate to use a given pattern.

### Design System

I built our internal UI Kit in Sketch libraries. The kit allows our designers to reuse components and styles without hunting through old files, or worrying about if they are using an out of date pattern.

I facilitate a move to tokenizing all of our existing patterns, allowing us to design and launch a dark mode across our entire product suite.

I collaborated with our frontend development team to create a comprehensive and testable react component library which allowed our devs to easily deploy our latest designs and stay in sync.

### Design Ops

I implemented version control for our entire design organization by moving all of our product and visual designers onto Abstract. I was also able to coordinate with the VP of Engineering on a trip to India and move the entire frontend engineering team (250+ devs) over to Abstract as our handoff tool.

I taught our design team on how to leverage the power of Sketch's design systems to build complex symbols with layout controls, nested overrides, and layer/text styles from the UI Kit.

I helped to standardize our design team's process around creating and prototyping new design patterns and handing them off to dev with clear specs, tokens, and guidelines.
